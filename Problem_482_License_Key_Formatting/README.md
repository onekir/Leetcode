# Problem 482: License Key Formatting

## Description

[License Key Formatting - LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/description/)


You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes (`-`). The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that:
- Each group contains exactly `k` characters.
- The first group could be shorter than `k` but must contain at least one character.
- A dash (`-`) should be inserted between groups.
- All lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.
