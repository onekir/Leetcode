# Problem 1791: Find Center of Star Graph

## Description

[Find Center of Star Graph - LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/description/)

There is an undirected *star graph* consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node connected to all other nodes, and no other connections exist.

Given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v]` represents an edge between nodes `u` and `v`, return the center of the given star graph.
