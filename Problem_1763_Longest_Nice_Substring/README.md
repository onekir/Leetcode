# Problem 1763: Longest Nice Substring

## Description

[Longest Nice Substring - LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-nice-substring/)

A string `s` is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, both its uppercase and lowercase versions appear. 

For example:
* `"abABB"` is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' appear.
* `"abA"` is not nice because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.

Given a string `s`, return the **longest substring** of `s` that is nice.  
If there are multiple, return the substring of the **earliest occurrence**.  
If there are none, return an **empty string**.
