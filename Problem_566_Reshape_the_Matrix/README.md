# Problem 566: Reshape the Matrix

## Description

[Reshape the Matrix - LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/description/)

In MATLAB, there is a built-in function called `reshape` which can reshape a matrix into a different size without changing its original data.

You are given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c` representing the number of rows and columns of the new reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order.

If the reshape operation is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix. Otherwise, output the original matrix.
