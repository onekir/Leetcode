# Problem 1971: Find if Path Exists in Graph

## Description

[Find if Path Exists in Graph - LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/description/)

There is a bi-directional graph with `n` nodes, where each node is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u, v]` denotes a bi-directional edge between node `u` and node `v`.

Given the integer `n`, the array `edges`, and two integers `source` and `destination`, return `true` if there is a valid path between `source` and `destination`, or `false` otherwise.
