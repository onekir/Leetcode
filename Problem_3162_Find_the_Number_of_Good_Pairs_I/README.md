# Problem 3162: Find the Number of Good Pairs I

## Description

[Find the Number of Good Pairs I - LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-good-pairs-i/description/)

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. You are also given a positive integer `k`.

A pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums1[i]` is divisible by `nums2[j] * k` (`0 <= i <= n - 1`, `0 <= j <= m - 1`).

Return the total number of good pairs.
